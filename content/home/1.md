Welcome! I'm George. I am a project manager, and I love good designs that are simple while solving complicated problems. 

I am always exploring how the evolution of technology can cause better, simpler solutions to come about that wouldn't have been possible before. **the winding road** are my explorations and learnings. 

A brief 411. I been a project manager in a wide varity of industries, from aerospace to health insurance to retail. I learned that no matter how complicate the problem is, the best solution is always the most simple one. I also consider myself a full stack developer, and have explored backend architcture design to application design and cloud deployment. 

*Curious learner. Systems thinker. Problem solver.*
