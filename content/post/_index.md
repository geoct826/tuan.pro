This blog is a collection of my interests and discoveries. There are no specific topic or focus, but typically it will be web application development based. I am a trier and tinker, and I am setting up this blog as a way to document my discoveries and learnings. I am not by any means an expert programmer or developer, but I find that the best way I learn new things is to try it and write about it.

Feel free to peruse.
