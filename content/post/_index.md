Domain names are pretty straightforward to come by these days. There are lots of domain sites like Hover, Namecheap, GoDaddy, HostGator, are just some examples. Moreover, new generic top-level domains like .me,  .beer, .cafe, are ensuring that there is no shortage of creative domain names going forward. However, what do you do once you find and purchase the perfect domain name? Building a website may not seem like it is for the faint of heart, and there is the cost involved with just hosting a site. It does not have to be that way.

I am setting up this blog as a journal of how I am setting up my professional site for as little of cost as possible, while still maintaining a full-time job and family life. I believe that anyone should be able to be part of the internet on their own terms without having to commit to a monthly fee.

So, welcome to my professional blog, *the windy road*.
